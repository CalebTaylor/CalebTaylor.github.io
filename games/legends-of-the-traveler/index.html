<h2>How it started</h2>
<p>I saw a Craigslist ad seeking a writer for a video game in development. Being 17, I was eager to join the industry so I replied. I never wrote for a video game before (not counting my own games) but I applied anyway citing my narrative forming skills and passion for video games. </p>


<p>The poster of the ad replied pretty quick and I found myself in an in-person interview a few days later with the Creative Director. He had a story already from a table-top campaign he made years back and wanted to turn it into a video game. He already had a developer in denmark making a tech demo, and had recently hired a concept artist and a level designer/3D artist.</p>

                </a>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>I started out just simply taking down the story as the Creative Director told it to me. I later broke up the narrative into its constituent arcs and plots, drew additional connections and removed redundant scenes that had no place in the story. Then I began ideating missions and levels surrounding major plot points. I developed core characters further, adding or removing features that would compliment them in the medium of a video game. </p>
                <a href="t6.png" target="_blank">
                    <picture><img src="tt6.png"></picture>
                </a>

<p>In meetings I contributed to the visual iterations of the characters since I spent a lot of time writing them. The concept artist and I exchanged ideas back and forth until we were happy with each other’s ideas. The Creative Director and I worked with the level designer as he roughly mapped out the introductory and important levels.</p>

                <a href="t4.png" target="_blank">
                    <picture><img src="tt4.png"></picture>
                </a>

<p>Later, when we were happy with the overall plot, I started working on a morality balancing system the Creative Director had in mind. He wanted choices the player made in the game to affect the world by having a sort of “karma tracker”. If the player caused harm to innocent people or destroyed things without reason, his negative karma would increase. The player would be feared among citizens, so they could have their way, but they were unlikely to receive aid as a result. </p><p>This wasn’t intended to impede progress or lend to a certain playstyle over another, but was meant to build atmosphere beyond textual / verbal information. People would cower in fear if you walked through town after burning the town previous, or welcome you with loving praise if you went above and beyond to help peasants. </p>

                                <a href="t7.png" target="_blank">
                    <picture><img src="tt7.png"></picture>
                </a>

<p>I built a small prototype in Processing, a Java standalone library and IDE, and simulated good and bad interactions to see how easily the scale of morality would tip to one side or the other. We tweaked numbers based off this model and we sent our results to the developer to implement when he was ready.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>The Creative Director spoke to a number of producers and other interested parties for funding. He wasn’t happy with the control they demanded, but was encouraged by the prices they were offering. He wanted to make the best game possible, and was in no rush to make it, so he decided to start a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teccrab/legends-of-the-traveler-the-journey-begins">Kickstarter campaign.</a> I suggested we ask $15,000, but the Creative Director was confident that we could ask for a lot more and still receive the funding. He set our campaign goal at $150,000. We pushed as hard as we could on social media and other digital marketing platforms but only made it to $16,695. </p>

                </a>

<p>We tried to continue development on the game despite having no funding, but the team slowly lost interest or moved on to better opportunities. The last nail in the coffin was our (only) developer landing a job at a AAA studio and leaving us. We wish him,and everyone else on the team well as they pursue their dreams elsewhere!</p>

<p>I learned a lot about what goes into making a 3D RPG game, and the various challenges that indie studios experience. I wore many hats during the development of the game and I loved every bit of it, right until the end.</p>
