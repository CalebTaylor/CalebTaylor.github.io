					</blockquote>
					<p>The Wishing Tower was an experiment in game narrative design and branching dialogue, which I made a custom dialogue system for. During the project, I handled all of the art, programming, and writing. I collaborated with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqm9DABSsjNz87qcAQEf5sg/videos">Strophic Valley</a> who provided The Wishing Tower with an amazing custom soundtrack. The brunt of The Wishing Tower's development took 3 months. You can play <a href="https://calebtaylor.itch.io/the-wishing-tower">The Wishing Tower</a> here.</p>
					<h4>Writing</h4>
					<p>I first drafted the story of The Wishing Tower back in 2019. It was supposed to be a longer experience with a focus on world building and dialogue-heavy prose, but as time went on,  I elected to shorten the narrative and test an idea I had for a custom dialogue system. While a bit expository at times, and rough around certain edges, I'm proud of the shortened story I was able to pull off in order to finally ship the game.</p>

					<p>
						The game features over 13 pages of dialogue. I designed 3 short conversations with branching dialogue and unique endings. The end result is a short but sweet 30 minute game about a father, his daughter, and the stories they pick up along the way as they seek refuge in a post-war wasteland. You can read more about my narrative system's design <a href="../Screenplay">here.</a>

					<p><i>The 13+ pages of dialogue, with branches and end behavior throughout.</i></p>

					<h4>Art</h4>
					<p>I illustrated close to 100 individual assets for The Wishing Tower (not counting animation frames) by hand, almost exclusively in the style of 1-bit pixel art. I experimented with GameMaker Studio's "application surface" to create a pseudo 2D lighting effect where I carve holes of light out of an opaque background. </p>

					<p>I developed a dynamic, real-time weather system which generates precipitation which falls around the player, and wind that pushes both the player and the weather particles around. The player will notice walking into a gust of wind makes it harder to walk, and will blow more ash in their direction.</p>

					<h4>Game Design/Development</h4>
					<p>The Wishing Tower turned out to be a largely relaxing and laid back experience, punctuated by the occasional "encounter" featuring a rhythm game inspired quick-time event system. I designed this system in such a way to be as simple to new players as possible, but still provide moments of excitement and action without taking too much away from the game's mood.</p>
					<img src="./assets/four.PNG">
					<p>The player will need to match the numbers/shapes together before they collide, or the player will "miss". A combo is applied for a successful streak of "hits". This system was used to uniformly handle gameplay like moving rocks and cutting fences.</p>
					

					<h4>What I Learned</h4>
					<p>Especially with a personal project, I found that I had to scale back my ideas to have any chance at finishing. Working on a project almost completely on my own was fun, but time consuming and complicated. I should have focused more on having fun before trying to ship a fully fledged game right out of the box.</p>
					<p>For more narrative focused games like The Wishing Tower was intended to be, I would dedicate a lot more time in the beginning towards the story. All other aspects of a game like this are secondary to the story.</p>
