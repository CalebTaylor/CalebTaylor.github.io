            <p><span class="d">"Let there be light."</span> She said.</p>
            <p>Matter tore into existence. Time became time, and space became space. </p>
            <p><span class="h">"I can't wait to see what you do with this."</span> He said.</p>

            <p><span class="h">"Oh."</span> He said. <span class="h">"Darkness? Why?"</span></p>
            <p><span class="d">"I have the agency to chose, don't I?"</span> She asked.</p>
            <p>He pondered for a moment.</p>
            <p><span class="h">"It's just that... not many choose darkness."</span> He said.</p>
            <p>Moments later a smile spread across his face. He shrugged, and seemed satisfied.</p>
            <p><span class="h">"Let's see how this goes."</span></p>

            <p>They both waited. No time passed, and nothing changed. Nothing was there <em>to</em> change, afterall.</p>
            <p>She smiled a satisfied smile before turning to ask him a question.</p>
            <p>"Isn't it nice?" She asked.</p>
            <p>He was confused.</p>
            <p>"How can <em>nothing</em> be nice?" He asked.</p>
            <p>"No pain, or suffering, or confusion. Nothing being destroyed, or corrupted, or lost. It's peace. True peace." She said.</p>
            <p>He looked puzzled. He tried in vain, unable to reach an understanding. She noticed.</p>
            <p>She waved her hands in front of her and a lone hydrogen atom appeared before them. The particle spun and jumped, erratic and random.</p>
            <p>"Look." She said. "Here we have an atom, somewhere else has none. <em>Everywhere</em> but here has none. Isn't that terrible? "</p>
            <p>He watched the atom dart back and forth infront of him. The lone particle amplified the lonliness of the Universe before them, and a chill ran through him.</p>
            <p>"You have a point. Get rid of it. Please." He said. She quickly removed the particle from existance and he sighed with relief.</p>

            <p>No time passed, yet they sat for what felt like forever.</p>
            <p>"You know..." He said. There was hesitation in his voice.</p>
            <p>"Yeah?" She asked. She turned to him and waited for him to continue.</p>
            <p>"I think you made the perfect choice." He said. She cocked her head sideways.</p>
            <p>"Is that so?" She asked. "What makes you say that?"</p>
            <p>He placed his hand on hers.</p>
            <p>"I have to admit. It's nice. Nothing can happen. It's predicatble." He said. She layed her head on his shoulder and thought for a minute before speaking.</p>
            <p>"Does that count as a choice?" She asked. "I didn't chose anything. In fact, I chose <em>nothing</em>."</p>
            <p>"Eve." He said. "In a way, you chose to <em>stay</em> here, with me."</p>
            <p>They sat in silence for moments more. She didn't object, nor agree, but simply squeezed him harder.</p>
            <p>"And guess what?" He said.</p>
            <p>"What, Adam?" She said with a laugh. It was if she knew what he was about to say.</p>
            <p>"I chose to stay too."</p>
            <p>And they did just that. Stay.</p>
