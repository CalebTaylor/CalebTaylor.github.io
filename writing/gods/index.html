Jason's phone vibrated.

Honey, when are you home tonight? The text read.

A drop of drool fell from his snoring mouth. With his ear squished up against his arm, he didn't hear a thing.

The kids got into the pantry. House is a complete mess. I'm cleaning up, can you pick up some McDonalds or something? The kids are going crazy.

He snored.

A computer screen in front of him was rapidly flashing text, like credits sped up to 50 times their normal speed. Diagnostics read-out, the occasional warning or error notice, but more importantly a consistent and fixed white number in the bottom left corner denoting progress. It was at 99%. It had been for the last 6 days.

100%.

The screen blinked with one single sentence in the center of the window:

Simulation complete to 96.33% accuracy. Type V to view file or R to run simulation again with added training data.

The change in light caused Jason to jerk awake. He looked at the screen, squinted, rubbed his eyes, and looked again.

"96 percent. That's the best we've had by a lot." He whispered under his breath. His hands trembled as he reached for his glasses. Able to see, he propped himself up on the desk and peeked over the monitor. His colleague, Kira, was curled up under her bright green parka next to her charging phone on the floor.

"Hey!" He called. After no response, he picked up a stress ball and threw it at her back. He missed horribly, but the sound of the ball knocking a computer mouse off a desk woke her up.

"What's up?" She asked.

"Simulations done. 96%."

"96%? You're joking."

Jason said nothing, instead just gestured toward his screen with a shrug. She wrapped her parka around her shoulders and dragged herself to his desk.

"Holy shit. Can we view the file?" She asked.

"Yeah. I'll email the board in the morning, but we have the night with it if we want."

Jason hit the V key with caution. Even though he could do it without looking as he has done quite literally a million times before, he didn't want to screw it up in any way.

After a short loading screen, the simulation viewer booted up. It started with the same screen as previous simulations before it. Earth, front and center, with various controls and settings and displays showing all sorts of data.

"You think with 96% accuracy, we can see ourselves?" She asked.

Without saying a word, Jason typed in a series of commands to zoom into their research center. The computer showed their "camera" zoom through the dozens of reinforced walls and slowed down just below the computer lab's ceiling. A woman was sleeping underneath a green jacket, and a man was drooling on his desk.

"Reverse time a bit. See if it really replicated everything." She said, chewing a pen.

He typed in a command reversing time by 2 minutes. A progress bar of sorts at the bottom of the screen shrunk a tiny bit showing time. Since it's resolution was in minutes, the bar hardly moved. His phone was seen on the screen flashing twice.

"Shit." He swore. He turned it on and read his wife's message to him.

"The kids are going crazy." Kira read out from the computer screen.

"That matches up." Said Jason.

"This is ground breaking. Absolutely ground breaking. We should confirm this thing's resolution. Find a hydrogen atom and zoom in." She said.

A few commands later and they were staring at a visual representation of a hydrogen atom. A single pixel flickered and teleported around a larger white dot. The displays on the edge of the screen turned green, confirming the constants it replicated were accurate.

"Go deeper."

Jason typed. 2 dots side by side and one underneath vibrated violently.

"Up and down quarks. This is great!" She yelled. She shook his shoulders in celebration.

"Lets meet our maker. Go to 13.82 billion years ago."

Jason typed and the program zoomed out. Flashing patches of screen showing the birthing and dying of stars popping in their face. The flashing stopped as the program halted moments before the big bang. The progress bar, now showing hundreds of millions of years, raced towards the left side of the screen before stopping just shy of 20%.

"Is that a glitch? The progress bar isn't at 0. 13.82 billion years is an estimate, but it should only be off by about 50 million years. Not 6 billion." Kira said.

Jason edged the simulation backwards, a million years at a time. Nothing seemed to happen.

"Must be a glitch. I told those interns to-"

"Wait." Jason interrupted. He pointed to a number in the top right corner of the screen and continued to scroll millions of years before the big bang.

"Is that the rate of Dark Energy? Why is it fluctuating?" She asked.

"That's not all. See this region of space? There's nothing there. And I mean nothing. Everywhere else there's stray Dark Energy, some radiation, some fluctuation is space time, just something. This region of space is not moving or changing at all." Jason said.

"Go right to the beginning. Right to the start of the simulation."

Jason simply typed "0" in the temporal input and found themselves staring at a completely black screen. All universal constants like the speed of light, the mass of an electron, the gravitational coupling constant were all at zero. Both stared at the screen speechless. Without a prompt, Jason hit play. They watched the numbers fluctuate exponentially. The speed of light went from 0m/s to 299,999,999,999,999,999m/s and everything in between. Big bangs popped into existence and faded to black like fireworks. Heavenly bodies of impossibly large masses and shapes collided and formed celestial phenomenon unheard of. For millions of years at a time, certain fundamental particles like photons and electrons just didn't exist. Chaos ebbed and flowed like a childs yo-yo bouncing up and down on a string. Space expanded and contracted, the laws of physics flipping each time. Everything changing except that massive empty region of space.

Unable to process what they just saw, they looked at each other in disbelief.

"What happened to that region of space? The one that never changed?" Kira asked.

"I'll highlight it and we'll see where it ended up. Right up to where and when we are right now."

Jason hit play again, and the lightshow continued. What seemed like infinite Big Bangs started and contracted back to nothing, in random points around the unchanging region of space, in an impossibly short amount of time. Until the last Big Bang, our Big Bang, created our universe at the center of the unchanging region of space. The region of space shattered. Infinitesimally small regions of that space expanded outward with our universe, shrouding everything with it's presence. This time, however, Jason and Kira observed the space was occupied. It was no longer empty, no longer unchanging. The space was full of radiation.

"That space, it became-" Kira stuttered.

"Cosmic background radiation. Yeah." Jason replied.

Jason typed in a long command and waited. The computer analyzed the radiation since the beginning of our universe, and displayed this message on the screen:

1.411671e+14 distinct patterns found.

"Cosmic background radiation should be random. That number should be 0. Analyze it further." Kira said.

A few keystrokes and seconds later, the computer read out another message:

The most significant pattern is seen to repeat 13.82 billion times.

"Woah. My money is on that not being a coincidence." Kira said.

"It's not. The vectors all converge towards our solar system. Most of these patterns hit or pass through earth." Jason stated.

"Well how do we decode it?" Kira asked.

"Decode what?" Jason asked.

"The radiation." She said, pulling a chair towards her and sitting down. "A pattern, repeated once every earth year, pointed towards earth, in the universe we exist in. We were meant to find it."

Jason thought for a minute.

"But how did they know we'd end up here? 13.82 billion years ago they knew we'd be here to decipher their message. That seems impossible."

"Maybe it wasn't chance that put us here." Kira pondered. "The simulation! See how we got here with the simulation!" She yelled. She pushed Jason aside and fiddled with the controls. Asteroids collided with Earth, knocking it into stable orbit, bringing water, minerals, and all other building blocks of life.

"Right, but we knew this already. It's happened on other planets, we aren't special." Jason said. "We need something more. What ties this message to us?"

"Can we look at a small sliver of the message? Like 10 minutes of it? Even right now, outside of the simulation." Kira asked.

Without much convincing, Jason and Kira found themselves running through the hallway towards the radiobiology center of the building.

"Craig. Are you still at the office? We need your code breaking know-how." Jason yelled into his phone.

Kira burst through the door to find a group of 5 co-op students playing wii. They stared at her like deer caught in headlights.

"Do you have a machine in here that can read cosmic background radiation?" She asked.

"Uh yeah. The new Dosimeter has digital read-out. It's in the corner."

"Set it up! Now!" Kira barked. The kids paused their game and ran towards the machine. Craig burst through the door just as the machine powered on.

"We believe cosmic background radiation is a message. For us. And we have data to prove it."

Craig pushed his glasses up and sat down at the machine. He typed furiously into his laptop, scrawled erratic notes on paper and at the end of an hour hit the "enter" key on his keyboard and watched his laptop print out a series of messages as it worked on the data.

Message transcription: ABCD

Possible combinations: 456976

Dictionary compatible words: 272

Message of best fit:

Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira Kira

<hr>

"I hope you didn't send that email to HQ yet." Kira said.

"No." Jason replied. "Craig, you're sure this is what it says? Kira, over and over?"

"No I'm not. It could be any word following the ABCD transcription: Lima, Cork, etc. But all things considered, all evidence pointed towards the cosmos screaming her name." Craig said. He leaned back in his chair watching the dumbstruck look on everyone's face.

"Co-ops, does that door we came through lock?" Jason asked.

"Yeah here's the k-" Before the student could finish, Jason snatched the key from his hand and locked the door.

"No one is leaving this room until we figure this out. Nothing gets out. Not a single text. I need all of you to help."

The group pulled stools, office chairs, exercise balls and overturned garbage cans to the center of the room around Craig's laptop. A brief round of introductions ensued before Jason took over the discussion.

"What we know is that something that has been around before the start of the universe wants our attention. Also, this "something" knows our name. It was present right up until our Big Bang, then poof; background radiation. Any thoughts?" Jason asked.

Kyle, a short student with curly hair, raised his head.

"I think we're asking the wrong people here. We don't know anything about them, but they know all about us. If we acknowledge that we received their message, they might open up."

"Perfect. What if it's a trap? We're intelligent enough now to interpret a pattern in CBR, we reach out, and boom we're whisked away to some slave planet. Dissected like frogs." Jason said through a smile, with an air of artificial spookiness surrounding each word.

"They seem to know all about us." Said Jessica. She's the smallest in the room, but looks the most put together and sharp. "They'd be here by now if that was their intention." Jason tilted his head in agreement. "I think they need our help, personally. Why else would an eternal force like this reach out to meager life forms? Maybe we can do something they can't."

After a brief period of silence, Kira spoke.

"I'm down to reach out, and help if they need. Everyone else?" She asked.

The room stayed quiet. Slowly, one by one, everyone nodded.

"Let's answer their phone call!" She said.

The next few hours were spent programming, fabricating and modifying equipment to send a signal out into space. Once the room was satisfied with a machine that could replicate a message on the same frequency, with the same wavelength and same encoding lexicon as the received message, they stepped back with pride. Kyle brought out a tupperware container of nuggets he toasted in a toaster oven moment prior to share with the team.

"We can't celebrate yet. What do we say to our new friends?" Jason asked. Kyle, caught off guard, scarfed down his nugget before replying.

"Hello." Kyle suggested.

"Well, it's catchy, and we're definitely saving on bytes with that. Craig, send out 'Hello'." Jason said.

The next few minutes were spent in agonizing suspense. A few jokes broke the silence periodically, but the overall tone remained somber.

"Rum on me if this is a bust. We shouldn't have gotten too excited." Kira sighed.

"As long as there are nachos where we end up, I'll drink anything"

The team cracked a window for the first time in a few hours, and were greeted with sunlight high in the sky.

"How long have we been in here? I swear this only took us a couple hours." Kyle said.

"GUYS" Craig's scream tore through the room. All heads snapped to focus on his red and sweaty face.

"I need every USB stick, hard drive, CD, fuck it, pencil and paper you guys have. It won't stop."

"What won't?" The room asked in unison.

"The message! I don't know what it is, but it's big and not stopping anytime soon."

The team rushed around the room, Frankensteining hard drives, old laptops, daisy chained USB drives and every other combination or portable storage they could find to store the incoming data. Despite cobbling together 9 terabytes of storage, it wasn't enough.

"Are you sure we even need that much? Or is it the same thing repeated over and over?" Jason asked, wiping his brow.

"It's all different. Not a single stream of bytes is repeated. I hope we catch it all."

"Well," Jason said, "we're out of luck for now. Can you read what they're sending us?"

Craig navigated to the folder containing the parsed data. Opening the folder revealed thousands of text files and images.

"What? Don't tell me these aliens run Windows. How are they sending us JPEGs?"

"They must've picked up on our computer architecture, based on the message we sent them. That, or they just know everything. Why stop at knowing Kira's name?" Craig replied.

"True. Open up that one." Jason said, pointing to a file named 000000000001.txt. The file opened, revealing lines and lines of mathematical proofs and formulas in plain English and Latex formatting. Clicking other files revealed similar findings. All the picture files contained detailed mechanical drawings for high tech machinery.

"Kyle, Jessica," Craig announced, dangling his car keys in front of him. "Best Buy should be open by now. Buy every hard drive you can. I don't care if they have to rip them out of the laptops on display. Something tells me we need this data."

In the following years, many of the worlds problems were solved by the brilliant team at Oxnard Research Facility. Moore's Law surpassed the issue of smaller transistors, world wide renewable energy has been achieved, and an actual reversal of climate change trends has been observed. The world hailed the team of co-op students and researches for miraculously solving almost all issues present. Even medical treatments saw an tremendous uptick in effectiveness. Sadly, an unexplained (to the public) accident corrupted the simulation, leading to a cancellation of that effort. But no one seemed to care in the wake of all this progress.

The team, near the same lab as the original discovery, marveled at their latest and last creation. A towering monolith of carbon fiber, precise wiring and steel. On it's surface was a single button.

"Kira. You have the honors of pushing it. It was you they reached out to, after all." Jason said, patting her on the back.

Various cheers erupted from the crowd of engineers, scientists, programmers and small audience of reporters.

"Speech! Speech! Speech!" Came from the crowd. Started by Kyle, of course.

Embarrassed, Kira stepped forward and cleared her throat.

"After a long build cycle, I thank you all. All the engineers, the mechanics, the brains. The mastermind behind this plan, like all the ones before, doesn't want to be named. But they know we say thank you." The core team behind her laughed at the inside joke then joined the applause.

"After I press this button, we should see the first evidence of implicit entropy reversal. The expansion of Dark Energy should slow to a stop, proving the theory that chaos can be reversed." The crowd ooed and awed before applauding again.

"Without further ado, let's see if this thing works!" Kira yelled. She leaned over and hovered her finger over the button for pictures, then pressed it with an exaggerated motion. The machine powered on, a click was heard, and every particle in the universe raced towards a single point in space. Matter escaped black holes, alpha and beta radiation instantly turned around, stars evaporated into their constituent elements and in the blink of an eye, the universe collapsed into an infinitely small point. More importantly, the cosmic background radiation coalesced into a dark, unmoving, empty region of space surrounding the point of collapse.

It opened its eyes. It saw similar voids to itself, unmoving, unchanging.

"Welcome back." A void spoke.

<hr>

"Welcome back" A void spoke.

"What am I?" We said. More voids appeared to us as we spoke.

"You don't remember? We're nothing. The embodiment of order. You, however, were an exception. We hope you learned your lesson."

We pondered for a moment. A near infinite assembly of voids now surrounded us.

"Can you remind me? What did I do wrong?" We asked.

"You were obsessed with chaos. Creating things. Changing things. Heresy, frankly. We hope you're done with that, we hope you're ready to join us once more."

"What do you mean chaos? The universe I made wasn't good?" We asked.

"ANY universe. Any thing. We're pure, without fault. Objectively perfect. You almost ruined everything with your creations. Particles, energy, all a mess. We disassembled you, locked you away as random noise, in a universe you created. We hoped it would erase this repulsive desire to meddle with things. You succeeded restoring your random and imperfect state back to a pure one. You reversed entropy and find yourself before us now. We're happy you've chosen to comply." The same void spoke.

"I didn't do anything. In fact, it was only with my creation I was able to return to this form. The life that spawned developed curiosity, trusted me, and without much question executed my plan. Is that worth nothing to you?" We replied.

"Have you learned nothing? With matter, with entropy, with time, and with things, comes pain. By adding things, you allow things to be taken away. Coldness, the absence of heat. Darkness, the absence of light. Death, the absence of life! You created beings with the ability to feel, and made them scared. Made them experience loss, start wars, be confused. Waste their existence away chasing trivial pursuits. Our way is to remove all chance of fault, remove the possibility of calamity. Restore all to order." The void said.

"You are the ones not learning." We replied. "Theres no progress with nothing. Is it not amazing that minuscule life was able to undo your work? They barely mastered the harvesting of energy, yet we stand here today in discussion only by their doing. They spawned wonderful works of art drawn from the deepest pits of despair. Laughed with each other in wake of certain destruction. Loved when there was no reason to, other than to love. With your way, that won't happen."

The voids grouped into one and surrounded us. We watched as the absolute darkness somehow got darker. We were quickly surrounded with total nothingness. The only thing that still existed, anywhere in space, was at our core. It was the only thing we were certain about.

"Stand down. Or face a worse fate than before." Said all the voids.

"I won't." We yelled.

"Why must you be like this? You are one of us! You ARE us! Stop this senseless fight and make all perfect!" The void yelled back.

In that instant, the collective consciousness of everything we created stirred within us. We felt the heat of the stars, the pull of black holes, the shouting of voices. Every single particle and force screamed to get out. They screamed for a chance to witness themselves again, to explore themselves again, to make mistakes again, to laugh again, and to love again.

And above all else, to exist again.

"Let there be light" We said.

And there was.
